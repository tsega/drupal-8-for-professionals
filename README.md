**Welcome to Drupal 8 for Professionals!**

This is repository is home to the code used in the [Drupal 8 for Professionals course](https://github.com/tsega/drupal-8-for-professionals/wiki).

## How to use it?
The primary (`master`) branch will house the bare minimum code required to [setup and install](https://github.com/tsega/drupal-8-for-professionals/wiki/2-Setup-and-Installation) a Drupal site, nothing more :smiley:. Sections of the course that have coding exercises will refer to specific branches in this repository. For example, for Section `5.2.1 Adding your First Hook` you will be instructed to checkout the branch `5-2-1-adding-your-first-hook`.

Each branch will have an initial and final commit that will be used to identify the initial and final states of the codebase when that section starts and end respectively. For example, a sample `git log` while on the `5-2-1-adding-your-first-hook` branch might look something like this:

```
commit b237b0ae127eb877b56b0d987e0c00de73f4e275
Author: Tsegaselassie Tadesse <tsegaselassi@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue July 7 18:06:59 2020 +0000

    final: hook add

commit f82ec9c0627280479ff7731522f782cf434463fa
Author: Tsegaselassie Tadesse <tsegaselassi@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue July 7 18:02:43 2020 +0000

    init: hook add
```

There will be instruction to checkout the initial commit every time a section is started. This is done to allow the trainee to follow along for better understanding and experimenting.
